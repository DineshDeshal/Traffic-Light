Dynamic Traffic Light
This project demonstrates a simple dynamic traffic light using web technologies. The traffic light cycles through the standard red, yellow, and green signals.

How It Worksüßêüßê?????

HTML (index.html):
The main HTML file that defines the structure of the traffic light.
It includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS (index.css):
Defines the styling for the traffic light and its lights.
The lights are represented as colored circles.
The opacity property is used to simulate the lights turning on and off.
JavaScript (index.js):
Contains the logic for controlling the traffic light.
The startTrafficLight() function initializes the traffic light by turning on the green light.
Timers are used to switch between lights:
 the green light turns off, and the yellow light turns on.
 the yellow light turns off, and the red light turns on.
 the red light turns off, and the cycle repeats.
Usage
Open index.html in a web browser.
Observe the dynamic traffic light behavior.
You can also manually control the lights using the buttons provided.
Feel free to customize the timing, colors, or add additional features to enhance your traffic light project! üö¶
